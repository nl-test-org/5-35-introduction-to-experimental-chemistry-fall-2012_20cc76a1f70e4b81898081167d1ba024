This course is the first part of a modular sequence of increasingly sophisticated (and challenging) laboratory courses required of all Chemistry majors: 5.35 Introduction to Experimental Chemistry, 5.36 Biochemistry and Organic Laboratory, 5.37 Organic and Inorganic Laboratory, and 5.38 Physical Chemistry Laboratory. This course provides students with a survey of spectroscopy, and introduces synthesis of coordination compounds and kinetics.

This class is part of the new laboratory curriculum in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Undergraduate Research-Inspired Experimental Chemistry Alternatives ([URIECA](http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/www/academic/urieca.html)) introduces students to cutting edge research topics in a modular format.
